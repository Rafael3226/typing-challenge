const alice1 = `"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact shape doesn't matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no "One,two, three, and away," but they began runningwhen they liked, and left off when they liked, sothat it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running halfan-hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, "The race is over!" and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"`;
const alice2 = `There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse wassitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. "Veryuncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice;"only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.”The table was a large one, but the threewere all crowded together at one corner of it :" No room ! No room !" they cried out whenthey saw Alice coming. " There's plenty of room!”said Alice indignantly, and she sat downin a large arm-chair at one end of the table."Have some wine," the March Hare said inan encouraging tone.Alice looked all round the table, but therewas nothing on it but tea. "I don't see anywine," she remarked."There isn't any," said the March Hare."Then it wasn't very civil of you to offerit," said Alice angrily." It wasn't very civil of you to sit downwithout being invited," said the March Hare." I didn't know it was your table," saidAlice ; " it's laid for a great many more thanthree.""Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter.He had been looking at Alice for some timewith great curiosity, and this was his firstspeech." You should learn not to make personalremarks," Alice said with some severity : " it'svery rude."`;
